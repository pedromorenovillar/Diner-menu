# Diner-menu project

A JavaScript-only project to show what I've learnt about this programming language (variables, conditionals, functions, arrays and data structures, loops, etc.).

## Project requirements
The requirements can be found [here](https://ww.devcamp.com/trails/41/campsites/275/guides/build-out-a-diner-menu-using-javascript), but the basics are:

Build out a diner menu and waiter interactions using **only** JavaScript prompts.

Have the Main Menu and a Sides Menu.
You get one entree and two side choices at regular cost.
- Show them the entire menu (print out)
- A user selects an entree.
- “Waitress” makes a comment based on their selection
- Comment can either be a comparison of the two items, or random comment pulled from a comment vault.
- Tell them the price
- Repeat the above options for side choices (comment and a price)
- Total up the cost

BONUS: Have breakfast, lunch, and dinner menu. Breakfast has different items, lunch and dinner have the same items but are different prices.

BONUS: Allow for item customization (how items are prepared, decide additional cost implications)
